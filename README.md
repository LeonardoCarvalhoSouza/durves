**Welcome to the Durves repository!**

I developed this project as a form of study and saw the possibility to open it up for the community to contribute. The tool is simple: generate a pattern of points through the following properties (so far):

- Matrix
- Dot radius
- Amplitude
- Waves
- Frequency

With this set you can generate artwork like the ones underneath to use in your graphic design projects, ui/ux, or anyone that requires creativity and good assets to generate an innovative idea.

I want you to contribute to this project at will, suggesting new features by [issues](https://github.com/filipeedr/durves/issues) or by asking questions by [dicuss√µes](https://github.com/filipeedr/durves/discussions), I see that this project has spectacular scalable margin üôÇ
